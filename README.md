# TripAdvisor-Reviews Sentiment Analysis

In this project:

In the jupyter notebook we implement a complete sentiment analysis on greek_hotel_reviews and restaurant_reviews datasets. Considering the greek_hotel_reviews the data was collected by scraping the tripadvisor site https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/ for hotels in Athens Greece or other location in Greece. While restaurant_reviews dataset was downloaded from the following site https://www.kaggle.com/damienbeneschi/krakow-ta-restaurans-data-raw .

## For this NLP task we perform several algorithms. These algorithms are presented below:

####  VANDER knowledge based unsupervised model
####  TFIDF (term frequency, inverse document frequency) vectorization to reviews dataset and the following ML algorithms to the vectorized dataset:
#### i. LogisticRegression
#### ii. KNeighborsClassifier
#### iii. RandomForestClassifier
#### iv. GaussianNB
#### v. SVC
#### vi. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) â€“ Keras Implementation
#### vii. AutoSklearnClassifier(from autosklearn.classification import AutoSklearnClassifier)
#### viii. Xgboost
#### ix.  Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer BERT.
